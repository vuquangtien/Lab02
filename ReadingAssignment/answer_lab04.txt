QUESTION: 
Alternatively, to compare items in the cart, instead of using Comparator, we can use the 
Comparable interface and override the compareTo()method. You can refer to the Java docs to see the 
information of this interface. 
Suppose we are taking this Comparable interface approach.
- What class should implement the Comparable interface?
ANSWER:
The class that should implement the Comparable interface is the Media class.

- In those classes, how should you implement the compareTo()method be to reflect the ordering that we 
want?
ANSWER:
In the Media class, the compareTo() method should be implemented to compare media items based on the 
desired ordering. For example, if we want to order media items by title, we can compare their titles 
using the compareTo() method. If we want to order by cost, we can compare their costs in the compareTo() method.

- Can we have two ordering rules of the item (by title then cost and by cost then title) if we use this 
Comparable interface approach?
ANSWER:
No, with the Comparable interface approach, we can only have one natural ordering rule for the items. We cannot 
have two different ordering rules (e.g., by title then cost and by cost then title) using the Comparable interface alone.

- Suppose the DVDs has a different ordering rule from the other media types, that is by title, then decreasing 
length, then cost. How would you modify your code to allow this?
ANSWER:
To allow a different ordering rule for DVDs, you can create a subclass of the Media class specifically for DVDs, such as 
DigitalVideoDisc. In the DigitalVideoDisc class, you can override the compareTo() method to implement the desired ordering 
rule (by title, decreasing length, then cost). This way, DVDs will have their own custom ordering rule while other media 
types follow the default ordering rule specified in the Media class.
